## __Debate__
I participated in three different debate team during my school time, "Debate team of Automation School", "Debate Team of Shenzhen University" and "English Speaking and Debate Society".

During that fantastic time of those debate teams, I have been to Suzhou to participate in the "English Debate Winter Camp", and ranked 13th in the British Parliament debate competition.

Planned and organized the biggest debate competition as the organizer and judged it as the adjudicator in internal school. At the same time,  I participated in debate competition, won "best debater" three times.

All in all, I love to express my ideas to others and more importantly, I am fancy about logical thinking.
