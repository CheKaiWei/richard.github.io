My name is Richard. (Chinese:车凯威) I am studying at Shenzhen University.
My major is automation, dreaming to be a robotics engineer.
During my school time, I have done four [projects](chekaiwei.github.io/projects). I learn a lot and also, gain a lot of honor from them.

In 2018, I [internship in DJI](chekaiwei.github.io/projects),  as a ROS and Computer Vision Engineer in Robomasters team. I am the only student selected among Shenzhen. 

I also love to express my others and more importantly, I am fancy about logical thinking.  Therefore, I participated in three different [debate team](chekaiwei.github.io/life-at-university) during my school time. 

This website is also my works. I love to create things new and belongs to me.
